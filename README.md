### LLMs - Simulator Frontend

This is the frontend for the [ASP.NET Core backend](https://github.com/xero-q/llms-studio-aspnetcore-cleanarquitecture-cqrs). It allows to select any model and start a thread on it. Then the user can start giving prompts in that thread to its model and receives the response.
